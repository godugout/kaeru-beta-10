    symbol: "金",
    japaneseName: "黄金",
    mainColor: "#c9b06f",
    origin: "Born from the tears of Tsukuyomi, the moon god, as they fell into a sacred mountain pool during the first lunar eclipse. Kogane emerged gleaming with golden skin that absorbed the divine lunar energy. The villagers who discovered this radiant creature built a shrine in its honor, believing it to be a messenger between the human and spirit worlds.",
    power: "Kogane bestows resilience and regenerative abilities to those who honor it. This golden frog's energy strengthens the body's natural healing processes and brings equilibrium to disrupted systems, much like the balance between the moon and earth.",
    ritual: "During the full moon, Kogane performs the Ritual of Golden Renewal—submerging itself in mountain spring water while absorbing moonlight through its skin. Those who apply Kaeru Gold with mindfulness connect to this ritual, channeling Kogane's restorative essence into areas of discomfort.",
    visualDescription: "In traditional Japanese art, Kogane appears as a luminous golden frog with subtle patterns resembling ancient calligraphy across its back. Often depicted seated on a lily pad floating in a moonlit pond, surrounded by gentle ripples that form concentric circles symbolizing expanding healing energy. Its eyes contain flecks of amber that seem to reflect ancient wisdom.",

    collection: "Adaptability",
    symbol: "変",
    japaneseName: "変更",
    mainColor: "#96b06f",
    origin: "When the shape-shifting tanuki sought to escape hunters by becoming a tree, it accidentally left part of its transformative spirit behind. From this essence emerged Henkō, a frog whose skin could shift between green and brown. The local farmers considered its appearance a sign that land and seasons were in harmony, honoring it with small shrines near their rice fields.",
    power: "Henkō grants the wisdom of adaptability and transformation. Its spirit teaches humans to move with life's changes rather than resist them, adjusting to new circumstances with grace while maintaining their essential nature.",
    ritual: "Twice yearly at the equinox, Henkō sheds its skin completely, absorbing the balanced energies of day and night. Devotees who massage Kaeru Adaptability oil using circular motions invite this transformative energy into their lives during periods of transition.",
    visualDescription: "Depicted in woodblock prints as a frog positioned between two distinct landscapes—one lush and green, the other autumnal and brown—with its body showing a gradient between these states. Artists often include a crescent moon above to symbolize change, with Henkō's skin detailed with minute patterns that seem to shift when viewed from different angles.",

    symbol: "安",
    japaneseName: "安らぎ",
    mainColor: "#6fa3b0",
    origin: "In the ancient forest of Yakushima, a monk's meditation was disturbed by inner turmoil until a small green frog appeared and began rhythmically inflating its throat pouch. The monk synchronized his breath with the frog's movements and achieved profound peace. When he opened his eyes, the frog had left a small green jewel—the crystallized essence of tranquility—which became Yasuragi.",
    power: "Yasuragi offers the gift of inner sanctuary and peaceful mind. Its presence helps humans create mental stillness amidst chaos, teaching that true sanctuary is carried within rather than found in external circumstances.",
    ritual: "At twilight, Yasuragi sings a single pure note that resonates at the frequency of perfect calm, causing dew to gather around it. Those who apply Kaeru Sanctuary balm with gentle pressure points connect to this vibration, creating islands of peace within the body.",
    visualDescription: "Illustrated in delicate ink wash paintings (sumi-e) as a small, vibrant green frog seated in perfect stillness on a moss-covered stone. A subtle aura of lighter green surrounds Yasuragi, suggesting its calming influence. Often shown with a single dewdrop balancing on its head, symbolizing perfect mindfulness, against a misty mountain background with minimal brushstrokes.",

    symbol: "生",
    japaneseName: "生命",
    mainColor: "#b06f8c",
    origin: "During a great drought, when even the river kami struggled to maintain life, a dying tree's last drop of sap fell to earth and was infused with the rising sun's first light. From this union emerged Seimei, a frog with eyes as red as dawn and skin as vibrant as new leaves. Its powerful leaps brought rain wherever it landed, restoring life to the parched land.",
    power: "Seimei bestows abundant vitality and the fire of sustained energy. Those who honor this frog receive renewed physical vigor and enthusiasm for life's activities, finding themselves capable of actions they once thought beyond their strength.",
    ritual: "At the summer solstice, Seimei performs the Dance of Enduring Flame—leaping between sun-warmed stones in precise patterns that generate vital energy. By applying Kaeru Vitality with quick, stimulating movements, users invoke this same life-enhancing power into their muscles and circulation.",
    visualDescription: "Portrayed in dynamic ukiyo-e prints with bold colors and strong lines, Seimei is depicted mid-leap with limbs extended and vibrant red eyes gleaming.

    species: "Glass Frog",
    collection: "Clarity",
    symbol: "明",
    japaneseName: "明晰",
    mainColor: "#736fb0",
    origin: "When a Zen master sought the ultimate truth by meditating beside a mountain stream for one hundred days, the water spirits were moved by his dedication. They crystallized the purest water into Meisei, a frog whose transparent body revealed the workings of life itself. The master understood that clarity comes not from hiding one's nature but from honestly revealing it.",
    power: "Meisei offers the gift of mental clarity and truthful insight. Its transparent nature helps humans see through confusion and deception—including self-deception—revealing the true nature of challenges and opportunities.",
    ritual: "Under the new moon when the stars shine brightest, Meisei submerges in the clearest spring waters, absorbing celestial light through its transparent skin. Users who apply Kaeru Clarity oil using gentle tapping motions around the temples connect to this purifying energy, clearing mental fog.",
    visualDescription: "Rendered in refined nihonga painting style with mineral pigments on silk, Meisei appears as a delicate, transparent frog through which one can see flowering branches or flowing water. Artists emphasize its crystal-clear quality by using subtle white highlights and nearly invisible outlines. Often depicted near reflective water surfaces or surrounded by small spheres representing pure thoughts, against a background of indigo representing the night sky.",

    japaneseName: "調和",
    mainColor: "#b08c6f",
    origin: "During the age when animals still spoke with humans, a village suffered from constant arguments and discord. The harvest goddess sent Chōwa, a frog whose melodious croaking contained all notes in perfect harmony. By listening to its song each evening, the villagers learned to balance their opposing viewpoints and work together, saving their community from dissolution.",
    power: "Chōwa grants the wisdom of harmony between opposing forces. It helps humans find the middle path between extremes, teaching that wellness comes not from eliminating opposing forces but from bringing them into balanced relationship.",
    ritual: "At both equinoxes when day and night achieve equality, Chōwa conducts a chorus of voices that creates patterns of perfect symmetry in pond water. Those who apply Kaeru Balance blend in spiraling patterns that alternate direction embody this balancing principle in their autonomic nervous system.",
    visualDescription: "Illustrated in balanced composition using the yamato-e style with decorative gold leaf accents, Chōwa appears as a harmoniously patterned frog with symmetrical markings in complementary colors. Often depicted centered between stylized elements representing opposites—such as sun and moon, fire and water—with musical note-like patterns emanating from its throat. The background typically includes elements from all four seasons in equal proportion.",
